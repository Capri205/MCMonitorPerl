# MCMonitorVB

Working on a monitoring page for our network of Minecraft and Source servers so I can see the overall health of the network at a glance.

Initially this is about reporting health and player join counts and history.
I will expand to include some management and administrative functions, like restarting a server.
Who knows, but it could eventually allow me to move off the admin UI I use for the servers today.

This is the Perl Catalyst version, and likely the one I will continue to develop.
